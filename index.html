        <h5>About sports</h5>
        <p class="p1">
            Sports are games where people try to win by following certain rules. Some sports need a ball, like soccer or basketball. 
            Others need special gear, like swimming or skiing. Sports are fun and can help keep you healthy. 
            They also teach you how to work with others and be a good winner or loser.1If I had to choose a favourite sport, it would be soccer. 
            It is a fun game where two teams play. Each team has 11 players. 
            They try to kick a ball into the other team’s goal. The team with the most goals wins. I love soccer because it needs teamwork.2

        <h5>Cricket</h5>
        <p  class="p2">
            Cricket is a popular team sport, played between two teams of 11 players each. It is played with a bat and ball and is combined
             with a set of skills, strategy, and passion on sprawling fields or compact arenas. Originating centuries ago, cricket has 
             evolved into a global spectacle, captivating diverse nations.
            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field with a 22-yard pitch and a 
            wicket at each end1. It is England’s national summer sport and is played throughout the world, particularly 
            in Australia, India, Pakistan, the West Indies, and the British Isles2.

        <h5>Football</h5>
        <p  class="p3">
            Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word 
            football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football 
            include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland 
            and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, Arena football, 
            or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of 
            football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes".
